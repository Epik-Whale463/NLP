# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Roadmap

## 1. Foundations of NLP
- **Text Preprocessing**
  - Tokenization: Breaking text into words or subwords.
  - Lemmatization vs. Stemming: Reducing words to their base forms.
  - Stop words removal: Filtering out common words (like "the", "is").
  - Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging: Identifying grammatical elements (noun, verb, etc.).
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying names, dates, locations, etc.
- **Text Representation**
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
  - Word Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText

## 2. Understanding Core NLP Tasks
- **Text Classification**
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Spam Detection
- **Sequence Labeling**
  - POS Tagging
  - NER
  - Chunking
- **Machine Translation**
  - Rule-based vs. Statistical vs. Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
- **Text Generation**
  - Language Models (e.g., GPT, BERT, etc.)

## 3. Intermediate Topics

  - GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)
  - T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Transfer Learning in NLP**
  - Fine-tuning pretrained models for specific tasks
  - Using models like BERT, GPT, or T5 for text classification, generation, etc.
- **Text Summarization**
  - Extractive vs. Abstractive Summarization
